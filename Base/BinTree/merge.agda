-- Merges two trees using combining functions.
-- 1st: Function to handle cases where only the first tree has a value.
-- 2nd: Function to handle cases where only the second tree has a value.
-- 3rd: Function to combine values when both trees have a value.
-- 4th: The first input tree.
-- 5th: The second input tree.
-- = A new tree where each node is the result of applying the appropriate
--   function based on the presence of values in both input trees.
